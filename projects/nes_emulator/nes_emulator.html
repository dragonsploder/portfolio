            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>An accurate, lightweight Nintendo Entertainment System emulator written from the ground up in Rust. This includes complete 6502 emulation (the chip that powered the Commodore 64, Apple II, and the BBC Micro). The project is about 80% done, however audio and extended mapper support are still ongoing.</p>
            <p>I worked on this project with a good friend of mine, check out his page: bronan.dev</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The Nintendo Entertainment System is a solid contender for the most influential console of all time. It single handedly brought back video games to the US after the crash in 1983, and was the starting point of many classic series, such as Super Mario Bros, Zelda, Metroid, Castlevania, and Megaman, just to name a few. As a massive retro nerd, I’ve been obsessed with it for a while. So I feel like it’s only natural that an NES emulator would be a fitting project to tackle during my college journey. And so in freshman year, along with help from my friend Ronan (bronan.dev), I dove headfirst into the project.</p>

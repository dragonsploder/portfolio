            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Self Control was my submission to the first game jam I ever participated in: The GMTK Game Jam 2020. The theme of the jam was "Out Of Control" and each team had 48 hours to make the completed product. I ended up creating a simple platformer where the jump was out of your control and instead would trigger at random times, designated by a bar at the top of the screen. I was a solo team for this jam, which means I did the design, programming, and art all by myself (although my dad helped with the music). This was also my first full project using Godot, so a good chunk of the time was spent learning how to use the amazing game engine.</p>
            <p>This project was great fun to work on, and it was amazing to actually release something. In fact the best part happened after the jam, where I got to play other games submitted, give, and receive feedback.

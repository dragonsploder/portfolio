            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>RGDC, or RIT Game Development Club hosts a few game jams each year. I finally got roped into participating by my friend for the 2023 Halloween on. The theme was "SPONTANEOUS" and we had 48 hours to create the game. Working in a group of 4 programmers and one musician, I ended up doing most of the art for this game. While I'm a programmer at heart, it was fun to diversify a bit and flex my rusty art skills. The game essentially entails corralling sheep into pens by pushing them around. To fit the theme, sheep will spontaneously transform into sheep eating monsters. It's a chaotic but enduring game that I had a blast to work on. Due to the high number of programmers, we ended up implementing some basic project management through a Trello Board. While it may seem a bit much for a game jam, I found it to be very helpful to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks. We actually ended up with a surprisingly polished game by the end of it.</p>

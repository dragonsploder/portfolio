            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Most common computers can only process numbers as large as their bus size (typically 64 bits). This is more then enough for almost anything you could want to do with a computer. However there are several cases, notably encryption, in which we wish to work with larger then 64 bit numbers. As we cannot do that directly on the cpu, all common math operations must be abstracted in software. This C header file provides such abstraction, allowing users to manipulate numbers of arbitrary size. Common operations like addition and multiplication are provided along side more complex ones like modular exponentiation which are useful in the context of RSA Encryption.</p>

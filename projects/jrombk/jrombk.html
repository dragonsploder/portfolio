            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Jrombk was my first ever hackathon, created for DandyHacks 2022. I worked on it at the University of Rochester with my two good friends in my first semester of college. For reasons still beyond me, we decided to create a Bomberman-like ascii game in C with LAN multiplayer. Needless to say, we were in a little over our heads. While we unfortunately were not able to make a completed game, a huge amount of blood, sweat, and tears allowed us to figure out C sockets and successfully connect the clients to a server. You can even move around and place bombs, even if they don't actually do anything. This is still probably my favorite hackathon, as it was extremely fun and we all learned so much in such a small amount of time. Celebrating at 3am in the morning because we finally sent data between our two computers will always be a treasured memory of mine.</p>

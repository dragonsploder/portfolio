            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Road Road was submitted to the GMTK Game Jame 2023 and the first game jam I worked on as part of a larger team. I worked alongside two other programmers, an artist, and a musician. The theme for this jam was "Roles Reversed". In 48 hours, we created a game in which the player places different road pieces to build a road which navigates around many different obstacles while a car races down it. There are many different game modes, from lasting a certain amount of time, making it a certain distance, or just chasing a high score.</p>
            <p>This is probably my favorite game jam creation. Working on a team was much harder then working solo, with problems ranging from agreeing on ideas to organizing working version control. However the extra man power produced a greater game then I could have ever made alone, and it was much more enjoyable to work on something like this in a group.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>My second game jam game, this time for the GMTK Game Jam 2022, was certainly more ambitious than the first. Not only did I do all the design, programming, and art, but I did the music for this one as well. The theme of the jam was "Roll of the Dice" and in the 48 hours available to me I made a fun little tile based pixel art puzzle game. The player must choose between different ways to influence dice rolls to move Gill the Generic Adventurer to the treasure.</p>
            <p>Like the first jam, I was very happy with how this game turned out. Having a bit more experience with Godot at this point, I was able to make a more complex and unique game which had a pretty clever take on the theme.</p>

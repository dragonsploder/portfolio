            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Katana is a simple arcade-ish roguelike I wrote over a few months in my junior year of high school. The idea was to finally finish a game and make it really polished. Most of my projects up until then had been given up on or felt more like demos than games. To that end, I decided to come up with a   relatively simple idea for a game and make sure I saw it through to completion. Thus Katana was born. The overarching ideas governing the game are: arcade-ish roguelike, non-direct movement, and a high level of polish. The first point is show by Katana's procedurally generated map and katanas, permedeath, and score system. The second point comes through with movement being selected by type (e.g. strike) rather then a specific direction. Finally the game has nice features like saving and loading which give it a bit of polish.</p>
